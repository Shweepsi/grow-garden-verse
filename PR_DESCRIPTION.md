# Fix 4 critical bugs for improved stability and performance

## üêõ Bug Fixes

This PR addresses 4 critical bugs that were affecting application stability, performance, and functionality.

### **Bug 1: Memory Leak in useGameData Hook**
- **Problem**: Realtime subscriptions were creating duplicate channels and not properly cleaning up
- **Fix**: Added unique channel names, removed unnecessary dependencies, improved cleanup logic
- **Impact**: Prevents memory leaks and multiple active subscriptions

### **Bug 2: Race Condition in Plant Harvesting**
- **Problem**: Plant was cleared before garden update, causing data loss if garden update failed
- **Fix**: Added fallback mechanism with proper error handling and rollback capability
- **Impact**: Maintains data consistency and prevents plant loss

### **Bug 3: Performance Issue in Plant Growth Service**
- **Problem**: Time calculations were inefficient and recalculated frequently without caching
- **Fix**: Added caching mechanisms for growth time calculations and update intervals
- **Impact**: Significantly improves performance and reduces CPU usage

### **Bug 4: Growth Speed Multiplier Logic Error - CRITICAL**
- **Problem**: Growth speed upgrades were INCREASING growth time instead of decreasing it
- **Fix**: Corrected calculation logic from `baseTime * multiplier` to `baseTime / multiplier`
- **Impact**: Growth speed upgrades now work as intended (plants grow faster)

## üîß Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `src/hooks/useGameData.ts` - Fixed realtime subscription memory leaks
- `src/hooks/usePlantActions.ts` - Added fallback for harvest transactions
- `src/services/PlantGrowthService.ts` - Added caching and fixed growth speed logic
- `src/services/EconomyService.ts` - Fixed growth speed multiplier calculation
- `src/components/garden/PlantSelector.tsx` - Fixed growth speed display logic
- `supabase/migrations/20241201000000_add_harvest_transaction.sql` - Added database transaction function

### Database Changes:
- Added `harvest_plant_transaction` function for atomic plant harvesting operations

## ‚úÖ Testing

All fixes maintain backward compatibility and include:
- Graceful fallback mechanisms
- Proper error handling
- Performance optimizations
- Memory leak prevention

## üöÄ Impact

- **Stability**: Eliminates memory leaks and race conditions
- **Performance**: Reduces CPU usage and improves responsiveness
- **Functionality**: Growth speed upgrades now work correctly
- **User Experience**: More reliable and faster application
